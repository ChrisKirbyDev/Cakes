            As you may have guessed, my name is Emily! I have grown up watching
            my Mum create wonderful masterpieces for mine and my sisters
            birthdays over the years and I couldnâ€™t help but want to get
            involved, making the odd thing out of icing for her to add to her
            creations every now and then.
          </p>

            After showing my friends at college these little additions to my
            Mums creations, a friend dared me to make him a birthday cake and
            bring it into college the next day. So off I went, stopping off at
            the cake supply shop and supermarket on my way home. I spent all
            night baking and decorating a cake, using every utensil I could find
            and making an absolute mess in the process! From there I made cakes
            for members of my family, for their birthdays.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Since then family friends and work colleagues heard about my cakes
            and asked if they could get a slice of the action and Cakes by Emily
            Eve was born! My creations have since improved (thankfully) and I am
            learning new techniques with each and every cake.

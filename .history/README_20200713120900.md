- my phone number
- choose from a type product (cupcake, celebration cake, wedding cake)
- add additional comments
- list allergies

OR!

To do this I go to the website main page and see a lits of pictures of different products.

I click on a product I like and I see a page of the product with a name, price, descriptions, ingredients (what else).

I can click on a button "Order", it will open a page with a form. I can fill the form (see above).
